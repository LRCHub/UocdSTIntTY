Honey I'm so lonesome
I don't know what to do
Honey I'm so lonesome
That I don't know what to do (yes, yes, alright)
The way you treat me momma, I hope you're lonesome too

Yodelay, yodelay-oh, yodelay-hee

Cruising 'bout Tennessee (oh, Tennessee
But the Texas women done got the best of me (North Carolina women)

Yodelay, hee-hee-hee-hee
